HTML5 mobile game made with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/). **virtualJCare** is an endless carer mobile web game.

Take care of J and enjoy the outfits.

J has three counters (**Health**, **Fun** and **Nutrition**), which are decremented every second. The game ends when one of them reach 0.

To avoid this situation you have 4 buttons, each one of them increase or decrease the counters:
  - Fruit: Good for health and nutrition...not fun though
  - Medicine: Very good for health but not fun or nutritional
  - Chocolate: So much fun
  - Jump: Super funny and healthy

Sometimes J could be hit by rocks which are flying over the room, be very careful!

Enjoy!
